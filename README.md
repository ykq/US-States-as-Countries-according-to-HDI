US-States-as-Countries-according-to-HDI
=======================================

Which countries match the Human Development Index of US states? 

In 2011, the Economist published a blog post comparing US states with countries according to GDP. This project uses the UN Human Development Index (which imputes measurements of health, education as well as income) to go beyond economic growth by visualizing inequality in Americans' opportunity to exercise our rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." It explores whether Americans from various states are essentially living in different countries - with Alabamans living in the equivalent of Kazakhstan, Louisianans in Libya and the top 19 states in the US (including California, New York, Wisconsin and Minnesota) whose residents might as well live in Norway.
